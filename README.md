# Argon v1.5

16-bit CPU implemented in SystemVerilog.

This is a work in progress! 

## Units on the internal bus
 - [x] ALU
 - [x] Register File
 - [ ] Control Unit
 - [ ] Memory Controller
 - [ ] Stack
 - [ ] Program Counter
 - [ ] Interrupt Handler
 - [ ] Device Controller (communicates with devices on external bus)

## Future Plans
- [ ] Verilator emulator (not super fast, but cycle-accurate!)
- [ ] Emulator (written in C++ for speed)
- [ ] Assembler (written in C++, Python, or both!)
- [ ] Physical implementation in an iCE40HX8K FPGA
