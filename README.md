a# Argon v0.6
Custom CPU with heavy inspiration drawn from MIPS to be implemented on an iCE40HX8K and run an OS, games, and more when combined with Krypton v2, a graphics chip I'll develop once I finish Argon.

### Quick spec sheet
- 32-bit data width
- 32x registers
- 32-bit fixed-width instructions
- Simple interrupt support
- 64x I/O pins directly accessible from registers
- No pipelining planned yet (this is my first CPU chill)
